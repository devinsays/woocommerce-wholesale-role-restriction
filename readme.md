### WooCommerce Wholesale Role Restriction

This extension prevents customers with a "wholesale" role from using coupons on the site.

It is based on the [WooCommerce Coupon Restrictions](https://woocommerce.com/products/coupon-restrictions/) and was developed for a customer who needed coupons to be excluded universally rather than on a per-coupon basis.
